        - You will have to keep an old copy of weights for convergence criterion function.
            Please use `np.copy(...)` function, since numpy might sometimes copy by reference,
            instead of by value leading to bugs.
        - You might wonder why do we also return bias here, if we don't need it for this problem.
            There are two reasons for it:
                - Model is fully specified only with bias and weight.
                    Otherwise you would not be able to make predictions.
                    Training function that does not return a fully usable model is just weird.
                - You will use bias in next problem.
